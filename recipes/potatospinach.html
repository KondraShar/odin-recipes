	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>A potato spinach casserole is a hearty, oven-baked dish made by layering thinly sliced potatoes with fresh spinach, sautéed onions, and a creamy, herb-infused sauce. As it bakes, the potatoes become tender and golden at the edges while the spinach melts into the layers, creating a warm, comforting meal that’s both rustic and nourishing.</p>
	<p>According to local kitchen lore, this casserole was first thrown together by a shepherd’s family living in a mountain cottage where winter supplies were scarce. One cold evening, with only a sack of potatoes, a bundle of late-season spinach, and a splash of cream left in the pantry, the family assembled everything into a single clay dish and slid it into the hearth. What emerged was a bubbling, fragrant casserole that kept them warm through the night. They shared the recipe with travelers, and soon it became a beloved comfort food throughout the region.</p>

	
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>800 g waxy potatoes, peeled and weighed</li>
		<li>1 tbsp butter</li>
		<li>1 tbsp flour</li>
		<li>2 onions</li>
		<li>2-3 garlic cloves</li>
		<li>400 ml milk</li>
		<li>200 ml cream (30% fat)</li>
		<li>300 g frozen spinach</li>
		<li>100 g cheese of your choice</li>
		<li>1 tsp salt</li>
		<li>1 tsp marjoram</li>
        <li>1 tsp freshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp nutmeg</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Melt butter in a pot and sauté onions for 2 minutes over medium heat until translucent.</li>
        <li>Add garlic and sauté for another 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in flour, gradually pour in milk and mix well. Add cream and bring to a boil briefly.</li>
        <li>Stir in the casserole seasoning and season with salt and pepper to taste. Feel free to season a little more generously, as the potatoes and spinach will absorb the flavor.</li>
        <li>Add the potatoes to the sauce and stir in gently. Cover and simmer on low heat for 10 minutes. The sauce will thicken due to the starch in the potatoes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 200 degrees Celsius (convection).</li>
        <li>After 10 minutes, stir in the spinach and mix well.</li>
        <li>Now pour the mixture into an ovenproof dish, sprinkle with cheese and bake for approx. 20-25 minutes.</li>
	</ol>
