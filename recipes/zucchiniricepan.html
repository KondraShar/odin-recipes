	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Zucchini rice is a warm, comforting dish made by sautéing tender zucchini with garlic and onions until they soften and release their aroma, then folding in fluffy rice that absorbs all the fresh, savory flavors. The result is a light yet satisfying meal with a gentle sweetness from the zucchini and a cozy, homemade feel.</p>
	<p>Legend has it that this meal was first improvised by a busy gardener named Lina, who returned home late one summer evening with nothing but leftover rice and a basket of zucchini. Too tired for anything fancy, she grated the zucchini straight into a pan, added the rice, and sprinkled in whatever herbs she had on hand. To her surprise, the dish tasted like the essence of her garden—simple, fresh, and unexpectedly comforting.</p>
