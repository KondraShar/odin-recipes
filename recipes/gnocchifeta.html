	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>This gnocchi feta dish combines pillowy-soft gnocchi with tomatoes, olive oil, herbs, and a block of creamy feta baked until it melts into a rich, tangy sauce. The gnocchi absorb the flavors beautifully, creating a dish that’s both indulgent and bright, with the feta adding a savory depth that ties everything together.</p>
	<p>Legend tells of a young street vendor in a Italian harbor town who invented the meal by accident. One busy market day, he was left with only a handful of gnocchi and a chunk of feta he forgot to sell. With customers still hungry, he tossed the ingredients with tomatoes and herbs, baked them quickly, and served the result. People were instantly hooked, praising the combination as bold, unexpected, and irresistibly comforting. From that day on, the vendor became famous for his “harbor gnocchi,” a dish that brought travelers back again and again.</p>
